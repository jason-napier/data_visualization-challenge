# Pymaceuticals Inc.: Anti-Cancer Pharmaceutical Analysis

## Mock Overview

This project is part of my work as a Senior Data Analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pioneering pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. Our recent focus has been on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer, for which we have conducted an extensive animal study to evaluate the efficacy of various drug regimens, including our flagship product, Capomulin.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this analysis was to generate all necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study, providing a top-level summary of the study results. This involved:

- Preparing the data for analysis.
- Generating summary statistics for the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
- Visualizing the data through bar and pie charts to understand the distribution of treatment regimens and gender among the mice.
- Calculating quartiles, identifying outliers, and creating box plots for tumor volumes across key drug regimens.
- Creating line and scatter plots to explore the relationship between time points, tumor volume, and mouse weight under the Capomulin treatment.
- Calculating correlation and linear regression between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.

## Technologies Used

- Python: For scripting and conducting statistical analysis.
- Pandas Library: For data manipulation and aggregation.
- Matplotlib Library: For creating plots and charts to visualize the data.
- Jupyter Notebook: For compiling and presenting the analysis workflow.

## Skills Demonstrated

In this project, I showcased my ability to:

- Manipulate and prepare large datasets for analysis.
- Use Pandas to calculate summary statistics and create summary tables.
- Utilize Matplotlib to generate a variety of charts, including bar charts, pie charts, box plots, line plots, and scatter plots.
- Perform advanced data analysis techniques, such as quartile calculations and outlier identification.
- Calculate correlation coefficients and linear regression models to understand relationships between variables.

## Key Findings

1. **Summary Statistics:** Generated comprehensive statistics that offer insight into the tumor volume's central tendency and variability across different drug regimens.
2. **Data Visualization:** Created multiple visualizations that highlight the study's distribution of treatments and the gender of the mice, as well as the efficacy of different drug regimens on tumor volume.
3. **Drug Efficacy Analysis:** Identified the most promising treatment regimens based on tumor volume reduction and consistency in results, with Capomulin being one of the leading treatments.
4. **Correlation and Regression Analysis:** Found a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin treatment, suggesting that weight may influence treatment efficacy.

## Conclusion

The analysis for Pymaceuticals, Inc. has provided valuable insights into the performance of various anti-cancer drug regimens. Capomulin shows promise as an effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma based on the analysis of the provided dataset. These findings will help guide future studies and potential modifications to treatment protocols.
